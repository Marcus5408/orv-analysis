# Obsidian

[Return to main README](../README.md)

I, for some reason, decided to make a [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault to create sort of my own ORV wiki. I'm not sure why, but I did. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish it, but here are the scripts I've used so far to make it. I might upload it as a seperate repo if I ever finish it.
