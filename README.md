# Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Analysis
All the stuff I used to generate a wordcloud of the ORV novel.
Also the stuff I used to generate analytics about the novel.

Includes:
- Unpacked EPUB (raw XHTML files)
- Extracted text from said XHTML files (unaltered and altered)
- Python scripts
- Word cloud clip image
