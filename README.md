# Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Analysis

All the stuff I use to analyze ORV. I'm not a data scientist, so I'm sure there are better ways to do everything I'm doing, but this is what I've done.

Includes:

- EPUB (raw XHTML files)
  - Note: they're zipped now on the repo because the sheer amount of xhtml files would make GitHub display this repo as being mostly HTML. just unzip the file and you're good. also EPUB is from [https://orv-epub.carrd.co/](orv-epub.carrd.co/>).
- extracted text from said XHTML files (unaltered and altered)
- various python scripts
- various project files involving ORV
